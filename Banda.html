                                        Constructed entirely of brick, stone, and cement without the use of steel, the bridge is an architectural marvel and a testament to the 
                                        ingenuity of its builders. The surrounding area is equally breathtaking, with tea plantations, dense jungle, and misty hills providing a

                                         and beautiful beaches. The highlight of Galle is the UNESCO-listed Galle Fort, a historic 
                                         fortress built by the Portuguese in the 16th century and later fortified by the Dutch. 
                                        Within the fort's walls, you'll find narrow streets lined with colonial buildings, boutique shops, 
                                        cafes, and museums.
